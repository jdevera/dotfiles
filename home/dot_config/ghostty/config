# Theme
# Run `ghostty +list-themes` to see all available themes
theme = Catppuccin Mocha

# Font
font-family = FantasqueSansM Nerd Font Mono
font-size = 19

# Window
# Makes the titlebar blend with terminal background
macos-titlebar-style = transparent
window-padding-x = 6
window-padding-y = 6

# Cursor
cursor-style = block
cursor-style-blink = false

# Mouse
mouse-hide-while-typing = true
# Use "clipboard" instead of "true" to copy to system clipboard on macOS (changed in 1.1.0)
copy-on-select = clipboard

# Quick Terminal (dropdown from anywhere)
# Toggle with Ctrl+` from any app
keybind = global:ctrl+grave_accent=toggle_quick_terminal

# Shell Integration Features
# Ghostty auto-injects shell integration for supported shells (bash, zsh, fish, elvish).
# Features not listed use their defaults. Prefix with "no-" to disable.
#
# Available features:
#   cursor       - Sets cursor to a blinking bar at the shell prompt
#   sudo         - Wraps sudo to preserve terminfo, so terminal features work in sudo commands
#   title        - Updates window/tab title via shell integration
#   ssh-terminfo - Installs Ghostty's terminfo on remote hosts when SSHing, enabling full
#                  terminal features (colors, cursor styles, etc.). Successful installs are cached.
#   ssh-env      - Falls back to TERM=xterm-256color if terminfo installation fails,
#                  ensuring compatibility with any remote host.
#
# Why no-title: Starship (my prompt) overwrites PS1 entirely, which wipes out any
# title escape sequences Ghostty's shell integration adds. Instead, window titles
# are handled via a custom Starship module [custom.window_title] in starship.toml.
# This also works around Ghostty's lack of title push/pop (CSI 22/23) support for
# programs using alternate screen mode (git diff, less, vim, etc.).
# See: https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/2667
